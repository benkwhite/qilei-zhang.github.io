## Airlines Seats Prediction and Competition Analysis
- Developed a neural network model to predict the number of seats sold for a given alpha market in certain quarters, using historical performance data from Diio Mi and the other economic data, demographics data, etc.

## Advanced Flight Data Analysis and Phase Identification for Emission Modeling

- Employed preprocessing techniques on flight records, incorporating meteorological data and other factors, to enhance data accuracy and completeness, enabling better analysis of operations at general aviation airports.
- Drawing inspiration from NLP techniques, such as Transformer and BERT, to process time-series flight data, thereby repairing, supplementing, and improving the integrity and reliability of data for advanced analysis.
- Developed a novel algorithm with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify aircraft trajectories into different phases, resulting in a performance improvement of over 20% compared to traditional methods, leading to better noise and emission modeling and addressing public concerns related to airports.

## Enhancing Commuting with Optimized Vertiport Distribution and Demand Estimation
- Investigated the feasible distribution of vertiports for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations using a Grid Distance Based Clustering optimization method, considering commuting demand in the Chicago metropolitan area to maximize the benefits of this emerging transportation service.
- Optimized processing for millions of demographic data points by employing matrix and vectorization operations, utilizing Google Maps Routes API, and conducting random sampling modeling with neural networks and regression analysis before applying the model to the large population.
- Conducted benefit-cost analysis, revealing an equilibrium point that resulted in a time value saving of $100M, demonstrating the effectiveness of UAM in reducing long-haul commute times.

## Pilot Performance Analyses and Training Evaluation for Inflight Safety
- Analyzed Inflight-Loss-of-Control accidents by assessing pilots' energy management performance, processing A/B test flight records into quantifiable scores using fuzzy logic, and enhancing accident evaluation.
