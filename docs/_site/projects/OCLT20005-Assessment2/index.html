<h2 id="activity-1-reflection-on-adult-learning-in-my-professional-context">Activity 1: Reflection on adult learning in my professional context:</h2>

<h3 id="transition-from-researcher-to-educator-in-aviation-management">Transition from Researcher to Educator in Aviation Management</h3>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Entering academia for less than half a year as a new lecturer in aviation management, I find myself navigating a significant transition from a PhD research assistant to an educator. This shift has triggered me to understand the importance of adult learning principles.</p>

<h4 id="from-research-to-teaching-shifting-approaches-to-knowledge">From Research to Teaching: Shifting Approaches to Knowledge</h4>
<p>In my doctoral study career, success was measured by the depth of expertise and the production of new findings. Communication was tailored to fellow specialists, often using technical language. Teaching, however, demands a different approach to knowledge. Early on, I approached teaching much like a conference presentation – loading content and technical details for delivery. I soon realized this approach could overwhelm students or miss the mark in facilitating learning. This prompted me to reflect on my teaching methods.</p>

<p>I must transform complex information into forms that novices can grasp, which requires pedagogical skills beyond subject expertise. In practice, this means using analogies, examples, and demonstrations that bridge theory and everyday understanding. For example, in aviation management classes, instead of simply presenting a research finding about airline operations optimization, I might use a familiar analogy (like scheduling for a ground transport system) to illustrate the concept. This aligns with Shulman’s view that teachers need an <em>“armamentarium of alternative forms of representation”</em> to convey ideas effectively [1].</p>

<h4 id="embracing-adult-learning-needs">Embracing Adult Learning Needs</h4>
<p>Most students in higher education are adult learners, which means their learning needs and characteristics may differ from those of children. Understanding adult learning theory has been crucial in shaping my teaching style, as my students range in age from early 20s to mature learners. Adults are typically motivated to learn things that have immediate relevance to their jobs or personal lives and tend to be more problem-centered in their orientation to learning [2].</p>

<p>In the context of aviation management, this situation suggests I may design learning activities that respect students’ autonomy and prior experience. For example, many of my students might have industry experience or work part-time in aviation-related jobs. I try to incorporate discussions and case studies that allow them to share their insights, thus valuing their experience as a learning resource.</p>

<h4 id="adapting-to-hybrid-and-digital-learning">Adapting to Hybrid and Digital Learning</h4>

<p>A major challenge I’ve encountered is adapting to rapidly evolving teaching methodologies. Unlike the traditional classrooms I was used to as a student, today’s learning environment at CQUniversity often blends face-to-face and online instruction. As an educator, I’ve had to learn how to engage students both in-person and through a screen simultaneously. I have seen this in my own classes: students appreciate being able to review materials online and attend remotely if needed, without missing out on participation. By incorporating a mix of synchronous online activities and periodic face-to-face sessions, I aim to provide the <strong>flexibility and autonomy</strong> that adult learners value, while still fostering a sense of community similar to traditional on-campus study [3].</p>

<h4 id="cultural-considerations-in-the-classroom">Cultural Considerations in the Classroom</h4>
<p>CQUniversity, like many Australian universities, hosts a culturally diverse student body. In my classes, I encountered misunderstandings that seemed to stem from cultural differences. For example, some students were reluctant to speak up or engage in debate during class discussions, which I later learned could be related to cultural norms regarding respect for teachers or <em>power distance</em>. Geert Hofstede’s research on cultural dimensions illuminates this phenomenon: in cultures with high power distance (where hierarchical authority is emphasized), students may expect a more formal teacher-led approach and might be less inclined to challenge or question the instructor [4]. In contrast, students from low power distance cultures (including the Australian educational context) are generally encouraged to interact openly and critically.</p>

<p>Another cultural factor is the use of examples and idioms in teaching. I learned to be careful with colloquial expressions, humor, or context-specific examples (like a niche sports metaphor or a local political reference) which might confuse those unfamiliar with them. Instead, I aim for clarity and universality in examples – or if I use a local example, I take time to explain its context. By being mindful of cultural differences, I not only help international students learn better, but also enrich the class for everyone by fostering cross-cultural understanding.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Embracing new teaching methodologies like hybrid learning and educational technology has been challenging, but it has ultimately enriched my practice and catered to the needs of modern learners. Just as aviation management is about continuous improvement for safety and efficiency, teaching is about continuous improvement for student success. As I continue in my academic career, I plan to remain a reflective practitioner, regularly assessing what works and what doesn’t, and staying informed by literature and feedback.</p>

<h2 id="activity-2-student-profile">Activity 2: Student profile</h2>
<p>The video highlights the reality of the “hidden curriculum” — the unspoken rules and expectations in educational institutions that advantage students already familiar with these norms. I profoundly relate to this issue, having experience across diverse educational systems in China, the United States, and Australia. Navigating each system’s implicit expectations has shown me firsthand how knowledge gaps disproportionately affect students who lack insider familiarity. Like Anthony’s “doubly disadvantaged” students, I’ve observed that many learners, especially international or first-generation university students, often struggle to decode these implicit norms due to cultural barriers, thus hindering their academic success.</p>

<p>Another critical point the video emphasizes is the psychological and motivational challenges faced by economically disadvantaged students. As one of the first-generation university students, I’ve personally experienced a lack of encouragement and vision stemming from economic hardship. Anthony’s narrative reminded me that students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds often avoid risks—not due to a lack of ambition but because the stakes of failure are significantly higher. They often do not realize the extent of their own potential because they’ve seldom been shown the possibilities beyond their immediate experiences. Reflecting on this, I believe proactive and explicit communication from educators about opportunities and resources is essential. Providing clear, consistent encouragement and demonstrating tangible pathways can significantly change students’ perceptions of what is achievable.</p>

<p>Recognizing these invisible barriers, I intend to adopt a more proactive approach in disseminating information, and consistently highlighting available resources and possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="activity-3-first-nations-people">Activity 3: First Nations People</h2>
<p>As an educator, respecting First Nations cultural protocols is not just a matter of courtesy but a necessary step toward genuine inclusion and equity within education.</p>

<p>Within my role, I can manage to respect these protocols by consistently starting my lectures and workshops with a culturally appropriate Acknowledgement of Country. Additionally, providing students with clear explanations of the meaning and importance behind these practices ensures deeper understanding and respect among culturally diverse learners. Integrating these practices into everyday teaching demonstrates their significance and encourages students to actively reflect on their roles in fostering cultural safety within the learning environment.</p>

<p>Respecting First Nations protocols is also foundational to ethically conducting research, particularly in areas affecting Indigenous communities such as one of my research field - remote and regional air transport services. this involves engaging local Indigenous communities proactively and respectfully from the beginning of any research project. Seeking the input of Elders and community leaders, understanding the culturally specific terms such as ‘Country’, and ‘Kinship’, and respecting community preferences and priorities in all my work are crucial steps. Ultimately, adherence to these protocols enriches the research process, enhances its applicability, and ensures respectful representation and collaboration, aligning educational practice with genuine reconciliation efforts.</p>

<h2 id="activity-4-inclusive-index">Activity 4: Inclusive Index</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the ‘Index for Inclusion’, it’s evident how its three dimensions—creating inclusive cultures, producing inclusive policies, and evolving inclusive practices—can significantly enhance aviation education, particularly pilot training programs. Creating an inclusive culture means embracing student diversity as a fundamental asset in aviation education. Given aviation’s global nature, students benefit profoundly when the curriculum and teaching practices reflect and respect diverse cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds, preparing them to function effectively in international environments.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dimension A involves creating an inclusive culture, emphasizing the necessity to foster environments where diversity is celebrated rather than treated as an inconvenience. As aviation education often involves highly structured training, there is a significant risk that students who differ culturally, linguistically, or through learning disabilities may face marginalisation without intentional inclusion. Dimension B, producing inclusive policies, demands that educational institutions actively develop supportive measures for diverse student populations. In aviation management, this involves designing policies that offer equitable access to training facilities and resources, adapting curricula and support mechanisms specifically for Indigenous students or learners from remote regions. Dimension C emphasizes evolving inclusive practices. As for this perspective, I can practically apply this by actively engaging with students, continuously seeking feedback, and adapting teaching styles to accommodate diverse learners’ needs, such as providing tailored support for students encountering cultural, linguistic, or physical barriers proactively, ultimately contributing to greater equity and inclusivity in aviation education.</p>

<h2 id="activity-5-learning-theories-comparison">Activity 5: Learning Theories Comparison</h2>
<p>Two learning theories that resonate deeply with me are Behaviourism and Cognitivism. Both theories acknowledge the crucial role of deliberate instructional strategies in learning and use well-defined steps and consistent feedback loops. However, their primary differences lie in their view of learner engagement and the cognitive process. Behaviourism, based on Skinner’s work, emphasizes observable behaviours modified through reinforcement and punishment, viewing learners as reactive entities. In contrast, Cognitivism, drawing from Piaget’s insights, highlights active mental processes where learners construct meaning and knowledge, viewing them as proactive thinkers. Reflecting on my past educational experiences, Behaviourism prominently featured during my earlier schooling in China, emphasizing memorization and disciplined practice, while Cognitivism was integral during my graduate studies in the US, emphasizing critical thinking, and problem-solving.</p>

<h2 id="activity-6-reflective-practice">Activity 6: Reflective Practice</h2>
<p>While I am teaching my units of aviation safety and aviation data science, I find that a blend of both Skinner’s <em>Radical Behaviourism</em> (Behaviourism) and Piaget’s <em>genetic epistemology</em> (Cognitivism) theories is effective. Behaviourism could effectively reinforce compliance with strict safety protocols through positive and negative reinforcement. For instance, rewarding consistent adherence to procedures can solidify habits essential in aviation contexts. On the other hand, Cognitivism is crucial in teaching aviation data science, where learners must understand complex algorithms and data interpretation by empirical examples and their experiences. By encouraging active engagement, critical thinking, and problem-solving, students can grasp the underlying principles and apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>I believe there is definitely a place for both pedagogy and andragogy in my teaching of aviation safety and aviation data science. In many cases, I teach adult learners who already have working experience in the aviation industry and want to explore more advanced topics or become a pilot. Here, an andragogical approach, such as treating them as self-directed individuals who will bring their experience or background into discussions, helps them learn practical skills they can apply immediately.</p>

<p>However, in the freshman units, where the majority of students are new to the university and aviation industry, a more pedagogical approach is necessary to build foundational concepts and ensure they have a solid understanding of safety requirements and data science principles.  In those moments, it can be important to offer clear, structured instruction with straightforward objectives and feedback. By combining both methods, I can respect adult autonomy while also ensuring that new learners build a strong foundation in critical aviation skills and knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="activity-8-contemporary-theories-of-learning">Activity 8: Contemporary Theories of Learning</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the contributions of Mezirow, Gardner, and Wenger, each theory offers unique insights that are valuable to my educational practice in aviation safety and data science.</p>

<p>Jack Mezirow’s transformative learning theory emphasizes the power of critical self-reflection and perspective-shifting. He proposes that learners do not simply acquire new information. Instead, true learning occurs when they question their own assumptions and beliefs, leading to deep, personal change. This theory resonates significantly with aviation safety education, where challenging existing assumptions and biases is crucial for cultivating a proactive safety culture and fostering a fosters more responsible and growth-oriented professionals.</p>

<p>Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences underscores the diverse cognitive strengths learners possess. This approach is particularly useful in teaching data science within aviation, a field demanding varied analytical and technical competencies. For instance, students may excel in various methodologies, such as inductive reasoning or deductive reasoning, to solve problems. This flexibility respects learner diversity and optimizes how they grasp core concepts in aviation contexts.</p>

<p>Etienne Wenger’s social learning theory highlights learning as fundamentally communal, occurring through active participation within communities of practice. In aviation, safety is never a solo affair. It relies heavily on collaborative practices and shared knowledge. Students who are actively working in the aviation industry can share their experiences and insights in study groups, enriching the learning environment.</p>

<h2 id="activity-9-educational-neuroscience">Activity 9: Educational neuroscience</h2>

<p>Reading these pieces reinforced my belief in understanding of how the brain learns and its similarities to neural networks in computer science. The continual, physical rewiring of neuronal connections occurs throughout our entire lifespan. Therefore, I can emphasize repetition and context-rich practice to reinforce neural connections critical for long-term retention. The neural networks also require a significant amount of data to learn effectively, and the special treatment of outliers. Additionally, understanding the brain’s limited attention span underscores the necessity of structuring lessons into concise, varied segments, interspersed with breaks or interactive elements. This aligns with the principles of noise reduction and attention mechanisms in neural networks, where the brain filters out irrelevant information to focus on what matters. I also resonate with the idea that students learn better when they see the “big picture” first. This concept is similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) process images by first identifying larger patterns before focusing on finer details. In aviation, showing the overall systems context might make each safety procedure stick better.</p>

<p>I completed the VARK test, and the results show I’m a Multimodal learner with strong preferences in Read/Write, Kinesthetic, and Visual styles. This result isn’t surprising, as in aviation safety and data science, I often use detailed reports, diagrams, and practical simulations. My high score in Read/Write reflects my preference for structured, documented information, which is essential in aviation safety compliance and data-driven research. Kinesthetic learning aligns well with hands-on aviation management tasks, like data analysis and simulations. Visual learning supports my teaching approach, utilizing graphs and visual data representations to clearly communicate complex safety metrics. This test reminds me that I should continue to mix up my methods—diagrams, reading materials, and hands-on exercises—to support learners with different strengths.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Theorist: 12
Activist: 6
Reflector: 15
Pragmatist: 12
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Taking the Mumford and Honey test gave me valuable insights into how I learn and teach. My highest score is Reflector (15), showing I prefer to gather data, and carefully think things through. Close behind are Theorist (12) and Pragmatist (12), while Activist (6) is my least prominent style. My strong theorist and pragmatist scores align closely with teaching practices that involve presenting aviation theories, statistical models, and applying these practically through real-world case studies. The lower activist score indicates that I tend to prefer analysis and careful consideration before action, essential qualities in aviation safety management. Recognizing this balance, I see no significant need to alter my teaching approach. Instead, it validates the importance of providing reflective and theoretically grounded learning experiences tailored to aviation data science and safety.</p>

<h2 id="activity-12-learning-experiences">Activity 12: Learning experiences</h2>
<p>When I was a freshman, I remember feeling a bit lost about the best way to learn. I used to rely solely on whatever the lecturers and textbooks presented, but the textbook structure didn’t always flow logically for me. One day, as I was going through some statistics fundamentals and trying to grasp certain data science concepts, I discovered that there were plenty of free online resources—like YouTube tutorials and educational blogs—that broke these topics down into clearer, more engaging steps. This was a revelation: I realized that simply reading the textbook wasn’t enough for me. I learned that combining hands-on practice (especially for programming), real-life examples, and external explanations from industrial experts could fill the gaps in my understanding. That experience changed my mindset toward learning. Today, as a university lecturer in aviation, I encourage my students to explore multiple avenues, especially in the era of AI. I tell them: If the textbook feels confusing, try an online tutorial, read different articles, or simply ask AI to give you an example. By diversifying our sources, we can piece together a more complete picture. That early lesson taught me that learning is not a one-size-fits-all process—it’s about finding the methods that click for each individual.</p>

<h2 id="activity-13-teaching-experiences">Activity 13: Teaching experiences</h2>
<p>Recently, I noticed that many students in my aviation safety course struggled with Quiz 1. Most of my lectures had been centered on PowerPoint slides, where I spoke while students passively listened. Reflecting on how I personally prefer a more interactive approach when I was a student, I decided to switch things up. I began using a blend of slides and real-time note-taking on the board. As I talked through key concepts, like referencing examples or concepts, I wrote concise notes or diagrams on the board. Meanwhile, the students could add their own annotations, creating a sort of “live” mind map. This shift allowed them to follow the content more actively, connect ideas, and ask questions right away. After applying this method for two sessions, the results spoke for themselves: Quiz 2 scores improved, and students seemed more engaged. This experience confirmed that small tweaks in teaching style can make a big difference.</p>

<h2 id="activity-14-philosophy-of-adult-education-inventory">Activity 14: Philosophy of Adult Education Inventory</h2>
<p>I completed the Philosophy of Adult Education Inventory (PAEI), and my highest scores were in Progressive (94) and Behaviorist (92). That reflects how I like to help students tackle real-world issues, like analyzing transportation data, and then see clear patterns in the data flow or time-series changes. My moderate Radical score (82) suggests that I also value broader societal impacts, which ties in well with promoting a strong safety/efficient/sustainable culture in aviation. Meanwhile, my lower but still notable scores for Liberal (78) and Humanistic (71) philosophies remind me to incorporate theory-based learning and personal growth whenever possible. Overall, these results confirm my preference for a hands-on, problem-solving approach where learners engage actively, just as I do when I study data reports or apply data science methods in an aviation context. It’s also a good reminder that sometimes I need to step back and offer more theoretical background or personal development opportunities to ensure a balanced, well-rounded learning experience for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="activity-15-biggss-theory-of-teaching-and-learning">Activity 15: Biggs’s Theory of Teaching and Learning</h2>
<p>After reviewing the materials related to Biggs’s theory, I can see parallels between my own experiences and the different “levels” of teaching. Early in my student career, I sometimes blamed low quiz scores on my own lack of motivation or not understanding the material (Level 1 thinking: “I just need to study harder”).  However, as I grew more experienced and became a lecturer, I found myself focusing on my teaching strategies (Level 2: “Maybe I need better slides or more lively examples”), especially when I was trying to explain complex aviation and data science topics. Lately, though, I’ve shifted more toward that third level, where I emphasize what the students actually do. By setting up hands-on data analysis exercises, interactive projects, and group problem-solving, I try to draw them into the learning process. I still use slides and lectures, but only as a springboard. In doing so, I’ve noticed students becoming more engaged, asking deeper questions, and retaining concepts longer. Ultimately, helping them take charge of their learning feels far more rewarding.</p>

<h2 id="activity-19-teaching-philosophy">Activity 19: Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>When I first stepped into the classroom as a new Lecturer, just after completing my PhD, I was excited and a bit uncertain about how my teaching philosophy would translate into practice. Nearly a year later, that philosophy has both evolved and strengthened through real classroom experience in aviation safety, aviation management, and data science subjects.  I now teach with a <em>student-centered approach</em> that reflects my passion and my growth into a more intentional and reflective educator.  I view teaching as a partnership in which students actively construct their own understanding. This idea is rooted in constructivist theory, which holds that knowledge is best gained through reflection and active mental construction. My role as the instructor is to facilitate this process by creating an engaging learning environment and guiding students as they build new knowledge on the foundation of their prior experiences. In what follows, I articulate my approach to teaching, how I implement active learning strategies, the ways I’ve grown through feedback and self-evaluation, and my goals for continually improving as an educator.</p>

<h3 id="pedagogical-foundations-active-and-student-centered-learning">Pedagogical Foundations: Active and Student-Centered Learning</h3>
<p>My core belief is that effective teaching goes beyond delivering lectures. It’s about actively engaging students in constructing their own understanding by connecting new information to their existing knowledge framework. In the fields of aviation management and data science, this means connecting theory to real-world applications. I often begin classes by linking new concepts to examples from industry, such as demonstrating how a machine learning algorithm might optimize air traffic flow or how a statistical model can improve aviation safety. This not only sparks interest but also follows a constructivist mindset, i.e., students build new knowledge on the foundation of familiar contexts. Furthermore, I strive to design learning activities that prompt students to question, analyze, and apply concepts during class. For example, I often present real-world problems (“What is the future for ATC in the AI era?”) for group brainstorming. These techniques compel students to engage cognitively with the material, leading to deeper understanding.</p>

<p>I set explicit learning goals at the start of each session so students know what to expect, and I conclude with a summary or real-life application to reinforce the material. This structured yet adaptable approach has been effective in disciplines like aviation, where safety procedures and regulations require precision, and in data science, where problem-solving can take multiple paths. Supporting this approach is <em>Cognitive Load Theory</em>, which reminds us that students have limited working memory. I heed its guidance by avoiding overwhelming extraneous detail and instead scaffolding information in manageable steps. This theoretical grounding gives me a clear rationale for creating an active, focused learning environment that keeps students mentally invested in their own learning process.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-methods-and-classroom-techniques">Teaching Methods and Classroom Techniques</h3>
<p>One of the most impactful strategies I’ve adopted is co-writing notes on a blank notepad with students, instead of relying solely on slides. In my early lectures, I noticed that speaking over dense slide decks often led to passive note-taking and reduced engagement. In response, I shifted to a more interactive, blackboard-style delivery.  This approach manages cognitive load, as too much information at once can overwhelm learners. By unveiling content gradually on the board, I help students focus on one concept at a time, minimizing extraneous load and reinforcing understanding. It also humanizes the classroom, as we collectively grapple with problems in real time. The positive feedback from students has been very encouraging. Many have noted that the step-by-step derivations and the slower pace of writing out or typing down notes help them follow complex material more easily than a slide-heavy lecture. Hearing a student say, “I finally understand this because we worked through it together in class,” has been immensely rewarding and validates this active learning approach.</p>

<p>That said, I thoughtfully integrate technology and visuals when they meaningfully enhance learning. In <em>Aviation Data Science</em>, I might show a short live demo of a Python script analyzing flight data or display a dynamic trajectory curve schematic as a visual aid. These are always accompanied by discussion and not simply read off slides.  In practice, this means I may begin a lesson with a brief slide overview for structure, then switch to the board for definition derivation or problem-solving, ensuring that technology supports rather than suppresses student interaction.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-improvement-inclusive-practices-and-lifelong-learning">Continuous Improvement, Inclusive Practices, and Lifelong Learning</h3>
<p>Over the past year, I have grown from a novice instructor into a more confident educator with a clear sense of purpose. This growth is fueled by <em>continuous self-evaluation and responsiveness to feedback</em>. Early lectures in my teaching experience, for example, I discovered through feedback that while students appreciated my enthusiasm and knowledge, some felt overwhelmed by the pace of my slide presentations. This realization was a turning point. In response, I redesigned my lectures to incorporate more pauses and interactive segments, and I shifted heavily toward the blackboard methodology I described earlier. The difference was palpable in subsequent weeks. Students remarked that the classes felt more personal and digestible, and their grasp of complex material improved. This experience taught me the value of closing the loop, i.e., using feedback to inform changes, and then observing improved learning outcomes, which further motivates me to keep iterating. It has also shown my students that I am open to obtaining feedback from them and continuously striving to improve, which is a humility and dedication I believe students respect and benefit from.</p>

<p>This reflective practice has not only improved specific courses but has also shaped my <em>educator identity</em>. Teaching aviation safety and aviation data science, I encounter students with <em>diverse backgrounds and prior knowledge</em>. Some students come with practical flight experience or strong technical skills, but others may lack mathematical fundamentals. I see this diversity as an asset rather than a hurdle, and I consciously adopt a <em>student-centered approach</em> that meets learners where they are. I strive to create an inclusive classroom where every student, regardless of their starting point, feels supported and challenged.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am committed to further developing my teaching practice and empowering my students to become independent, critical thinkers. A key teaching goal for me is to prepare students for the rapidly changing landscape of engineering and data science, especially in the era of AI. In my classes, I emphasize critical inquiry and practical application. For example, instead of solely letting students use a specific AI for data analysis, we first delve into the foundational principles of the underlying algorithms. Then, I might present them with a complicated problem where one-step prompts are insufficient, requiring them to compose their own logic chains or even explore emerging AI tools to devise a solution. This fosters adaptive learning by encouraging them to learn how to learn. By doing so, students learn to leverage artificial intelligence as a resource while honing their own problem-solving skills. I want them to leave my class not just with knowledge of today’s tools, but with the confidence and curiosity to learn new tools that will emerge in the future.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, my teaching philosophy has matured through practical experience, reflection, and a deepening understanding of educational theory, similar to flying, which is a journey of continuous learning and improvement. By staying true to my core values of active engagement and scholarly teaching practice, I am confident that I can empower my students to soar to new heights in their learning and, in doing so, inspire and equip my students to excel as lifelong learners in a dynamic world.</p>
